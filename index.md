## About

Hachimi Edge is the third full translation mod for the game, following in the footsteps of UmaTL and Carotene, and the first to fully support game modding on Android.

A fork of the unmaintained Hachimi mod, it began as a way to quickly serve fixes for issues after the game update on 2025/09/24 to users, and has since incorporated additional features and fixes by various community members.
The original Hachimi mod has been officially discontinued by its developer on 2026/01/17.

## Game components modified

Modifications are applied dynamically, no asset patching needed!

- UI text & buttons
- Dynamic game text (skills, names, descriptions, effects, …)
- Game dialogue (main story, home interactions, character stories, …)
- Lyrics
- Textures & sprites
- Videos

## Plugins

Hachimi Edge supports a [plugin system](/docs/plugins/about) that allows extending its functionality.

## UmaPatcher

UmaPatcher Edge is a helper app to easily patch Hachimi Edge into the game on android. As integral part of the Hachimi project, it too is a fork of the old and unmaintained UmaPatcher.
The latest Hachimi Edge version is automatically downloaded when patching, so you don't have to worry about anything else.

## Translations

Translation sources are indexed from various external community projects. Hachimi provides a framework to modify the game, but does not do or manage any translations itself and has nothing to do with these sources.

Not finding translations for newer content? Looking for a different language? Hachimi Edge indexes more and up-to-date repositories than the original.

Check out the sources in more detail on the [credits page](credits.md) for general info, progress, help, and getting in contact.
