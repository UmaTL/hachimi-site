# Documentation
Welcome to the Hachimi Edge documentation page!  
Check out all topics on the left sidebar. On mobile, you can find them in the menu at the top left.

## Installing Hachimi
Check out the [Getting Started](/docs/hachimi/getting-started) page.

## Contributing as a translator
Hachimi Edge needs translators for its UI, site, and guides. If you would like to help with this, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/hachimimod) and mention the `Developer` role.

To help with game translations, check out the [Translation Guide](/docs/translation-guide/welcome) and contact [one of the external projects](/credits.md).

## Creating your own translation source
Once you're familiar with the [Translation Guide](translation-guide/welcome), learn how to [configure a repo](translation-guide/repo-config) and submit your project [to Hachimi Edge's index](https://github.com/UmaTL/hachimi-meta).
You can look at one of the [existing projects](/credits.md) for reference.
